# Data Structure and Algorithms code samples by [CodersTea](https://www.CodersTea.in)

## What it is?

We have created basic algorithm's code in java for you to take a quick look for brushing up your algorithms skills.
This contains basic Data structures and algorithms. We have also included [LeetCode](leetcode.com) questions (work in progress).

## What you need is...

* Java 11
* Junit 5
* Maven
* Basic Data structures and Algorithms
* Currently, we are only adding codes and not full explanation (except comments)

## LeetCode
For Leetcode we have put it in the separate package and named the clas as the problem number.

## How to use it

Its simple, we have tried to add comments as to what we are doing. If possible we will add out blog's or YouTube's link for more explanation.
So read it to get the idea about how we tried to solve it. Our solution may not be the optimal or similar to yours.
As everyone's thinking is different and there may be more than one possible solutions. If you have more optimal solution please do contribute to this repo.

### Testing

* The Core logic is in the `main` and testing code is in the `test` packages.
